<h2>Products vs. Services</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This section provides a broad outline of the ways in which products and services differ. It also highlights a few of the points at which they are dependent upon each other and where and how the two might intertwine.

As you read through this section, consider your project through the lens of product versus service. Do some of your Opportunities definitely speak to being expressed as a product or a service? Might some of their possible designed outcomes be both? Is it still unclear for some? </p>

After you have read through this section, locate your Opportunties  along the spectrum of products and services discussed here. If some of your Opportunities do not seem to fall clearly on this spectrum, look to the Design Operations Guide for direction on how you might break those Opportunites down further.</p>

<h3>Products</h3>
<p>Products are defined by economists as made, or manufactured, objects, typically created in a factory setting. They tend to be single-instance interactions between buyer and seller. Even if you go to a coffee shop and buy a coffee every day, each purchase of that coffee is a new event; the coffee is the product, while the coffee shop is providing the service of selling coffee. You buy and consume new coffee everyday, but the service of providing that new coffee, the touchpoints, the culture, and the community of the coffee shop, is ongoing and intangible. </p>

<h3>Services</h3>
<p>According to economists, services are items that are not manufactured and are typically delivered on-demand. In the words of the Economist magazine, Services are “Products of economic activity that you can’t drop on your foot”. They tend to be ongoing, or things you return to again and again, unlike the single-instance events that characterize products. In addition to the coffee shop example, other examples of common services include educational services, tax preparation services, and insurance services.</p>

<p><i>
“One way to think of [products and services] is from the clients’ point of view. When a client asks “what can you make for me?” they are asking about products; when a client asks “what can you do for me?” they are asking about services. While a product is something that can be measured and counted, a service is less concrete and is the result of the application of skills and expertise towards an identified need.” </i><br>
