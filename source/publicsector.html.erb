<h1>Design in the Public Sector</h1>
<h2>Public Sector Design differs from Private Sector</h2>
<h3>Differences in Need</h3>
<p>Design in the Public Sector can seem a slower, more complicated affair than its Private Sector counterpart. However, each sector has its own unique values and pressures, terms to fulfill and spaces to explore. While the Private Sector is pressured
  by a constant need for increasing profit and the short-term thinking that they require, the Public Sector must respond to citizens and support the long lifespans we now enjoy.
</p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>
  <strong>VHA and preventative health</strong><br>
  One example of this difference is in the practice of preventative care now prevelant in the Veterans Health Administration’s (VHA) paradigm of healthcare. Moving away from the interventionist and symptom-driven healthcare modality of the previous
  century and centuries before, VHA now encourages veterans and their families to consider their health as an ongoing and integrated process of formal and informal actions and collaborations. This approach as resulted in a decrease of veteran need for
  specialized surgery and an increase of daily health markers, such as moving from a pre-diabetic state to a healthy state through weightloss management programs and support, and the long-term mental health support needed by those people living with
  PTSD or other emotional traumas.
</p>
<p>Many healthcare groups in the Private Sector know that the preventative healthcare approach is more effective at managing individuals’ care. However, because Public Sector healthcare centers around billing practices that support pricey, specialty
  services and interventionist practices that are easily billed for, they struggle to implement the more effective process piloted by VHA. This is not to say that the Private Sector has nothing to contribute in this space, but that this space would be
  unexplored if not for the differing values and timelines of the Public and Private Sectors. Because of this difference, both spheres of healthcare can benefit from one another.</p>

<h2>Serve All the People...</h2>
<p>Design in the Public Sector means designing for all groups living or affected by the system for which we design. Whether of differing abilities, backgrounds, or worldviews, ages, or practices, design in the Public Sector must allow each group to
  access products and services. This means that the testing groups necessary for this space are massive, but must be addressed.</p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>
  <strong>USDA School Lunches Application</strong><br>
  In 2012, the US Department of Agriculture approached The Lab with a problem around school lunch applications: too many of the students who were eligible for free school lunches were not filing or completing the necessary paperwork to receive their
  meals, and so too many kids were going without lunch at school.
</p>
<p>After problem framing and research, USDA and The Lab concluded that some simple tweaks could result in massive change. One of the most banal and yet effective: lengthening the first line in the application form so that it accomodates longer and
  perhaps multi-part names. Because the form had been designed with prominately English names in mind, many parents had seen that their names and the names of their children would not fit, and given up on the form. By lengthening the line as well as
  shortening the form, the USDA is anticipated to save $5 billion in payouts due to paperwork error over 5 years.</p>

<h2>...but Define Audience</h2>
<h3>Not exclusion; precision</h3>
<p>In any design process, the sheer number of people for whom one is designing can be intimidating. To get it right, to include everyone, to consider all the angles, are all pressures design teams feel throughout their process. How, then, can a team
  effectively design for such a massive number of people as the entire public? The answer is that designers must define the audiences for their work. An imporant disinction here is precision in design, not exclusion to design. We have to be fair and
  inclusive of all people, which means designing at a precise scale of product, as opposed to a small scale of people.
</p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>
  <strong>18F’s Web Design System</strong><br>
  18F’s Web Design System allows a global community of designers and developers to contribute to the online presence of U.S. government services. It also makes consistent the online experience of millions of Americans as they move through and explore
  their government services. This is a huge benefit to both end-users as well as administrators of these systems insomuch that greater modernity and clarity of online experience results in fewer errors and greater access to and satisfaction with
  government services.</p>
<p>18F is able to provoke this massive change through a careful limiting of their design scope: they are only designing for the online experience of participants, not the in-person, not the mixed use. They focus in on making the online experience as
  informative, clear, and flawless as possible and work hard to continue updating their designs to reflect the constantly changing uses, capabilities, and demands of technology so that the people are satisfied and delighted with this experience: no
  scope creep allowed.
