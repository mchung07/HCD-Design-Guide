<h1>Participants</h1>
<h2>Consider potential change</h2>
<h3>In stakeholders, in workflow </h3>
<p>The design process strives to include all possible stakeholders in the Discovery phase. The thinking is that, if teams talk to all the people involved in touching a product or making a system function, and design for and with all those people, then the solution will serve the needs of all those people. </p>
<p>Many times, this is largely true. However, as one moves through the design phase, teams need to evaluate how the proposed solution might change the workflow or burden on any of these groups. Teams can do this through talking to the groups as the process goes on, testing with them, and listening to anxieties about being expected to do more or being cut out of what they see as key to their work. </p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p><strong>Time Reporting software</strong><br>
Many industries, including the Public sector, use time reporting software to report and record employee work time. This software periodically needs to be overhauled or replaced completely to reflect changes in work practices or integrate new technology. </p>
<p>In creating this software, designers must consider that any change in reporting will cause some initial slowdown in reporting as people get used to the new tool, but they also must consider how a new design might skew one group or another’s burden of work. For example, when the Office of Personnel Management onboarded new time reporting software in 2018, it was clear that the designers had  considered transparency in the process but not work burden. In pursuit of transparency, the designers set up the system to email both the employee and the supervisor of changes to the employee’s time reporting, each time a change was made by anyone. This results in supervisors receiving potentially dozens of form emails each reporting period, that they then have to individually elimnate from their inboxes. In this case, transparency is served, but work burden is increased in an unproductive manner. </p>


<h2>Value new participants</h2>
<p class="usa-font-lead">And design for the newest-newbies</p>
<h3>Not everyone has context</h3>
<p>New participants are perhaps the most difficult people to design for. How can a team anticipate all their needs? How can testing ensure that the product or service is lean enough to navigate though quickly but dense enough to provide all the information a new person might need? </p>
<p>One answer to this is through rigorous testing with a variety of participants, new and experienced. Although new users might be difficult to find, it is crucial that they are consulted during the design phase so as to avoid creating a product that speaks only to the experienced. </p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p><strong>USAJOBS</strong><br>
The USA Jobs website is well-known to many federal employees. Through this jobs application portal, one can find a position that fits with a desired career path, background, employment preference, and General Services level. In the past, this site has been run by the federal goverment as well as by private entities, but without exception, it has always been a dismal experience. </p>
<p>Navigating the site required a participant to understand multiple points about their employment opportunities that they might only have if they had already had experience with federal employment. Even if an applicant did have previous understanding of the federal hiring system, the site’s structure made it almost impossible to understand if they had successfully applied for a job or not. Applicants had no visibility into where their application was in the hiring process. And, unless someone explictly reached out to them, they had no way of knowing whether their application was still moving through the system or if they had been dropped from consideration. </p>
<p>These pain points have been considered during the massive redesign of the site from 2015-2018. Although still reflective of a maddeningly byzantine hiring path, both applicants and hiring managers now interact with a more modern, less occluded system. This change was made possible by constant testing with new and experienced users as changes were proposed and built. No feature of this site shipped without hearing from participants about their experience with it. This sort of large-scale change is possible only through a long-term commitment to change that is paired with a constant return to focus on the participants themselvs. </p>
