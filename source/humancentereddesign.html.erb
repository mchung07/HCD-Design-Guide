<h1 class="guide-section__title">Human-Centered Design</h1>
<h2>What is HCD?</h2>
<p>Human-Centered Design (HCD) is a problem-solving framework that helps make systems and products more responsive to the people, or the customers, who use those systems and products. It requires rigorous qualitative research, directing that research
  towards the goal of deeply understanding the needs, insights, and emotions of customers. By using Human-Centered Design, we can focus our time, resources, and energy on solutions and innovations that make service delivery effective, easy, and in tune
  with the emotions of our customers.</p>
<p>HCD involves four phases of sequential work: discovery, design, delivery, and measurement. HCD is also cyclical. Once a design solution is launched, we measure its effectiveness against initial and intended aims, and then we continually tweak it,
  thus improving the solution over time. HCD recognizes that people and their needs are dynamic and changing and so our solutions are dynamic and changing.

  <p>HCD allows us to understand the types of experiences customers want from a system, product or service. We refer to the customers’ desired experience as the “front stage” of the design effort. HCD also helps us craft the processes that creates
    those desired experiences. We refer to this behind-the-scenes work as “the back stage” of the design effort. By tending to the front stage and the back stage, HCD allows us to put the customer at the center of our design development.</p>

  <p>The HCD approach has already created immense value in advancing agency missions. For example, redesigning USAJOBS, the hub for federal hiring where nearly 1 billion job searches are done annually by over 180 million people, has resulted in a 30%
    reduction in help desk tickets after the first round of improvements. Not only does this reflect an easier experience for those involved in the hiring process, this change also creates savings in support costs.</p>

  <h2>HCD Process</h2>
  <p>HCD is a cyclical process that moves from the discovery phase, through a detailed design phase, flows into the deliver phase for evaluation and iteration before finally entering the measurement phase. It begins with empathetic or sympathetic
    engagement and research. We hear from people in their own words, so we may gain an understanding of what they want and need from the agency.
  </p>
  <p>By using HCD in our work to improve agency services for our customers, we can identify innovations or solutions that are desirable, feasible, and viable. Then, we design the solution, launch it, and measure its effectiveness against our initial
    goals. If the solution falls short of those goals, we make revisions based on further feedback from users and test it again. This dynamism is inherent to the HCD process. HCD solutions are for people and situations who are dynamic and changing, so
    the solutions are also dynamic and changing.

  <h3>Discovery</h3>
  <p>The first Human-Centered Design Guides in this series focused on the Discovery phase. You should have completed or be near completing your Discovery as you pick up this part of the series. In Discovery, you built a problem frame, observed
    situations and listened to users and stakeholders.</p>
  <h3>Design</h3>
  <p>With your insights gathered and opportunities defined, you’re entering the Design phase. In this phase, you will start to build prototypes and work through design ideas. You won’t try to perfect these too soon. Instead, you will prioritize
    iteration, testing with customers, and making incremental refinements. Build, test and repeat.</p>
  <h3>Deliver</h3>
  <p>After prototyping and testing, you will work with stakeholders to plan the logistics around the launch of your design work. You’ll also set goals and expectations for the launch phase.</p>
  <h3>Measure</h3>
  <p>In the Measure phase, you gather quantitative and qualitative data to learn if the goals and expectations of your work are being met. When applied, this data will help improve your design.</p>

        <strong>Desirability Lens</strong>
      </p>
      <img src="/images/HCD-desirability_lens.svg" class="float-left height-card">

      <p>The Desirability Lens, popularized by the design consultancy, IDEO, illustrates that Human-Centered Design should focus at the intersection between of what customers want (DESIRABLE), what is possible with current means (FEASIBLE), and what is
        capable of working within constraints (VIABLE).</p>

  <h2>Working with HCD</h2>
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>This section provides a brief conceptual background for Human-Centered Design (HCD). While not exhaustive, this summary explains that HCD is a rigorous social science methodology used by groups in the public and private sectors to understand
    complex, interrelated problems and then craft dynamic solutions.</p>

    </span>Review and take stock of past efforts that are relevant to your current project. What previous work has been done in this area? Can you measure the effectiveness or validity of these past efforts? If you find previous work to be effective and
    valid, how will you integrate those findings into your current project?

  <h3>Basics of the HCD Approach</h3>
  <p>Human-Centered Design is grounded in empathy and understanding. It begins with observation and research. We hear from people in their own words, in order to gain an understanding of what they want, expect, and need from a system, product, or
    experience.</p>
  <h3>HCD and LEAN</h3>
  <p>
    <img src="/images/HCD-lean.svg" class="height-card-lg center">
  </p>
  <p>HCD and LEAN complement each other. HCD is based heavily on qualitative research, while LEAN is quantitative. LEAN enacts the first two Es of customer experience: Ease and Effectiveness, very well. HCD also enacts Ease and Effectiveness, but adds
    the third E, Emotion, into the process, through an understanding of human needs, and identification of the desired experience.</p>
  <p>The two methods complement each other. HCD helps to define the desired customer experience front-stage, and then LEAN can be used to architect the backstage to deliver on that desired experience.</p>
