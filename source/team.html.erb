<h2>Getting to simple is hard</h2>
<p class="usa-font-lead">Budget Time. And People. And Patience.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>“How long will this take?” has to be one of the most terrifying questions any designer will be asked when embarking on the design phase. The simple answer is: one can’t know. And also that constraints are useful.
</p>
<p>What we do know, from years of experience and many, many design case studies, is that getting to a simple, easy-to-understand, and useful solution to any design problem is the result of many rounds of iteration, problem-solving, and testing.
</p>
<h3>Making Decisions</h3>
<p>To move through those iterations, design teams find themselves making a lot of decisions. This process can be anxiety-inducing, as it means the design won’t meet all the needs of the participants. This decision-making is, however necessary. What a
  design team is trying to do is to make a precisely useful new solution for a precise problem, not to make a large, unweidly solution that tries (and fails) to solve all the problems encountered by the participants.

<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Interstate System Signage</strong><br>
  One example of a simple, large scale, public design solution that has stood the test of time is the Interstate Signage system developed under President Nixon. In this work, the service of signage U.S. interstates needed to work inside incredible
  constraints. To name a few, the system had to be scalable across the entire country; it had to work across any interestate exchange style that might have been built in any topography; and it needed to be immediately recognizable by drivers, which
  means maintaing consistency in tone and word use across any variation of signage need.</p>
<p>This system had to be expressed as a series of products, the signs, which have to function well for drivers travelling at high speeds, in vehicles of wildly different height and agility, in both daytime and at night.</p>

<h2>No Solitary Geniuses</h2>
<p class="usa-font-lead">No one designs in a vaccuum.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Working in teams allows use to utilize the unique background, training, and natural talents of a variety of people. In the same way that design teams go out and talk to participants during the Discovery phase, they also work as integrated teams
  instead of silo-ing themselves. This allows design teams to hear multiple points during the making phase, in the same way they heard multiple points of view during the Discovery phase.</p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>
  <strong>NASA’s Mars Rover</strong><br>
  When the NASA undertook to land a rover on Mars, no one person accomplished the task. Not even one leader can take credit. Instead, to land and operate a rover successfully on Mars, NASA leveraged a team of engineers, scientists, and designers to
  take on the task. When the rover landed and started collecting important information regarding conditions on the Red Planet, the team celebrated.

<h2>It Takes All Kinds</h2>
<p class="usa-font-lead">Design for people unlike youself</p>
<h3>Empathy</h3>
<p>The word “empathy” is often used in the design circles to describe an ideal emotional state between designer and partcipant in which the designer has so deeply learned about the participant that they can, as nearly as possible, stand the shoes of
  the partcipant themselves. Operating at a high level, empathy can and should be practiced in tandem with a more targeted sense of sympathy. Sympathy, the ability to feel a similar emotion to another person, allows designers to make a cognitive leap
  across experiences so that they can design for the participants wholly different from themselves. Keeping these two types of emotional intelligence in mind during the Design phase allows designers to create solutions for people whose experiences they
  will never have, but with whom they can empathize at a high level and with whose experiences they can sympathize.
</p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>
  <strong>The Lab and VA</strong><br>
  The Lab and the Department of Veterans Affairs have a long-standing partnership at the federal level. In this partnership, Lab team members partcipate in research and design work in many parts of VA, oftentimes working directly with veterans and
  providers.
</p>
<p>One of the key components of designing in this space is, for Lab team members, the practice of empathy and sympathy. Although not many Lab team members are veterans themselves, the act of gathering stories, of hearing and studying with veterans,
  allows the designers to understand at both broad and precise levels the needs of veterans when, for example, they transition from military to civilian life.
</p>
<p>An example of empathy in this area would be the abiltiy of a Lab team member to broadly draw on their understanding that change often results in anxiety. An example of sympathy would be the Lab team member understanding that departure from a
  military career is a unique experience unlike one they have had in their lives, but one that can and should be designed for and around.
