<h1>Design Phase Principles</h1>
<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>When in the Design Phase, keep in mind the following principles. We’ll go through them in more detail in the following pages:</p>
<ol class="usa-list">
  <li>Getting to Simple is Hard
  </li>
  <li>No Solitary Geniuses</li>
  <li>It Takes All Kinds (to Make the World Go ‘Round)</li>
  <li>Consider New Participants</li>
  <li>Value New Participants</li>
  <li>Public Sector Differs from Private Sector</li>
  <li>Public Sector Serves Everyone</li>
  <li>Define Your Audience</li>
  <li>Design is not permanent</li>
</ol>

<h2>What are the things we design in the Government?</h2>
<p>You might be asking yourself what gets designed in the public sector? The government does not have a product or product suite it sells; it does not construct services and offerings packages to sell like private companies do.
</p>
<p>While the first part of that statement is true, the second part is not. In fact, the public sector designs products and services constantly. Until recently however, the sector simply did not apply the rigor or professionalism of a design practice
  to its designed objects and services.
</p>
<p>A driver’s license, an application for a building permit, and interstate signage are all designed objects; pedestrian rules, the tax code, and the National Parks System are all designed services. Each of these examples have roots in laws,
  policies, and iniatives from legislatures, agencies, and other government bodies, but, to grow the ideas from their roots into a functional product or service requires a design process — whether conscious, careful, and intentional, or not.
</p>
<p>Oftentimes, a service is underpinned by many products. One example of this is the National Parks System. You may think of National Parks as just a bunch of open air, but it is in fact a collection of services that include wilderness preservation
  services and scientific research opportunities. It is supported by various products, including signage, websites, apps, uniforms, housing, and others.
